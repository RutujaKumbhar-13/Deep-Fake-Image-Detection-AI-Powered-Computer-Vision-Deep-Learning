# Deep-Fake-Image-Detection-AI-Powered-Computer-Vision-Deep-Learning
This project focuses on detecting deep fake images using state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning techniques. By leveraging computer vision models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Xception, and Vision Transformer (ViT).
Dataset split into three scenarios: 1. 80% Fake, 20% Real 2. 80% Real , 20% Fake 3. 50% Fake, 50% Real
